The parser is a two step parser, it includes two steps:

Find all variables
Evaluate variables



Each line of global script begins with one of the following:

int - defines an integer
string - defines a sting
function - defines a function
# - comment, ignore this line
\n - ignore this line


Each line of evaluated script begins with one of the following:

$ - starts a variable assignment
# - comment
\n - ignore this line
int - defines an integer
string - defines a string
return - returns a variable / string / int
call - calls a function
} / EOF - ends the evaluated script (when in a function)
